                <p>As, the holiday season approaches, I am reminded of all of the foods and drinks I enjoy back home, and no family gathering is complete without sorrel. Sorrel is Jamaica's version of a Hibiscus drink, made from the Roselle Hibiscus flower. The flowers from this plant are harvested in the Caribbean around November, so it has become a staple for Jamaican holiday gatherings. But the blossom's petals can be dried and stored to be enjoyed year-round. The wine-colored drink is refreshingly sweet, with a spice infused kick. This recipe is easy to follow, and the best part is, you can adjust it to your own personal tastes. This drink can be stored in the fridge, or in a cool dark place for up to a year. If you're planning to serve this drink at your next gathering, it is reccomended to make it a couple days in advance. It'll get better with age!  Gather the ingredients listed below, and enjoy!</p>
