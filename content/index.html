        <h1>Sorrel Recipe</h1>
        <h2>What is Sorrel?</h2>
        <p> Sorrel is Jamaica's version of a Hibiscus drink, made from the Roselle Hibiscus flower, aka sorrel. This plant comes into season in the Caribbean around November, so it has become a staple for Jamaican holiday gatherings. But the flower petals can be dried and stored to be enjoued year-round. Recipe by my Mother :D</p>
