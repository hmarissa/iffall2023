        <h1>Intro Q & A</h1>

        <p>1. My name is Marissa Hart. I'm a junior majoring in Communication Design.</p>

        <p>2. This class is required for my major, but I'm also interested in learning UX/UI design and majoring in HCI, so this is a good start.</p>

        <p>3. I dont have much experience with HTML/CSS/JS, but I'm excited to learn!</p>

        <p>4. I hope to learn how to communicate effectively through a digital canvas.</p>

        <p>5. I think designing for screen will require more consideration of how things will show up on a variety of screens. </p>

        <p>6. <a href="https://rainforest.arkivert.no/#kart">Save the Rainforest</a> is a website that has a good design. I like the interactive aspect which allows users to explore the forest while getting information.</p>

        <p>7. <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> is an example of a website that exemplifies effective communication. It offers users many browsing options and lots of information regarding their trip.</p>

        <p>8. <a href="https://awesomeinc.com/">AwesomeInc</a> works well in showig off the company's work to users in a way that they can't miss. The navigation is also simple so information is clear.</p>
